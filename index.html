            <p>Team 2594, the NASKCOrpions, has been part of the First Robotics Competition since 2008. With the help of our sponsors and the guidance of hardworking mentors, our team made up of students from all three NSD high schools, works to build and program a robot. In this competition, students are challenged to hone teamwork skills, design, and make a robot to compete in regional events. Our team provides students with a fun, safe, and cooperative work environment with like-minded people to pursue their STEM interests.</p>

            <p>Each year, teams are assigned a six-week work period to build a robot that can accomplish a new game's tasks. Teams take their bots and compete in regional events held all throughout the world. The culture of the program is based on two core values. "Gracious Professionalism" embraces the competition inherent in the program, and "Coopertition" emphasizes that teams can cooperate and compete at the same time.</p>
